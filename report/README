Haskell Report Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.verb files
~~~~~~~~~~~

.verb files are converted to .tex by the preprocessor "verbatim" in
../tools.  When generating HTML via tex4ht, we use a slightly
different version of the preprocesor, in ../tools/verb-tex4ht.


make targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   all       make both HTML and PDF versions
   html      make the HTML version
   pdf       make the PDF version
   clean     remove generated files
   haddock   re-generate the library documentation using Haddock
             (see Makefile for instructions)

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

haskell.verb  -- Top level of the report

Sections of the report:
intro.verb
lexemes.verb
exps.verb
decls.verb
modules.verb
basic.verb
io-13.verb
ffi.verb
standard-prelude.verb
syntax-iso.verb
fixity.verb
derived.verb
pragmas.verb
haskell.bib

Library documentation, generated by Haddock:

libs/*.verb       -- documentation for each library module
haddck.sty        -- definitions for macros used by Haddock

Extra .verb files:
iso-chars.verb    -- Some bogus definitions for ISO chars.  Probably not 
                  -- needed since I removed them from the syntax. 
index-extra.verb  -- extra stuff to get indexed (see also's)
index-intro.verb  -- header for index

Haskell source files:

Prelude.hs
PreludeList.hs
PreludeIO.hs
PreludeText.hs

Figures:

classes.ppt       --  The original class figure (Powerpoint)
classes.eps (*)   --  Postscript version of class-fig
classes.gif (*)   --  For html version
cover.cdr         --  A nice looking cover for the report
cover.eps (*)

Html support:

ht/haskell.cfg     -- tex4ht configuration file
ht/haddock.sty     -- customised Haddock style for HTML output

index.html         -- (unused now) Top level of the html report (hand generated)
lambda.gif         -- (unused now) background for title page

Other files:

Makefile         -- Lots of extra cruft no longer used. 

Report any problems to the most recent editor, or failing that, one of
the past editors of the report.


Making figures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The classes.eps files, which contains the classes hierarchy figure,
is made in Powerpoint, from classses.ppt.  To get the .eps file,
do the following:

* Open classes.ppt
* Print..
* Check the print-to-file box, and save as classes.prn
* Edit classes.prn
	Kill the .prn header and footer (before % PS-Adobe), and after %EOF
	Kill the entire setup code (from BeginSetup to EndSetup)
	Kill the showpage near the end
* Save as classes.eps
* Open with Ghostview
* Note the coords of the bottom LH and top RH corner, as reported by
  Ghostview
* Re-edit classes.eps, and put those coords in the
	%BoundingBox line

You also need to do
	Save As.. 
in Powerpoint, and save the thing as classes.gif, for the HTML version
