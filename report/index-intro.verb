Index entries that refer to nonterminals in the \Haskell{} syntax are
shown in an "italic" font.  Code entities defined in the standard
prelude (Appendix~\ref{stdprelude}) or in the \Haskell{} Library
Report\cite{libraries}
are shown in @typewriter@ font.  Ordinary index entries are
shown in a roman font.
