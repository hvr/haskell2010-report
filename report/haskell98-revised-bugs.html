<h2>Errata in the 
<a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/definition/">Revised Haskell 98 Language Report (2003)</a></h2>

The list below gives all known errors in "Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: the Revised Report",
published by Cambridge University Press as a book, and also in the Journal of Functional Programming
13(1) (Jan 2003). 
All page references are to these texts, which may differ slightly from the online versions.

<ul>
<p><li> [Feb 2003] <strong>Page 123, Section 8.2, PreludeText.</strong>
In the defintion of <tt>lex</tt> make the following changes:
<ul>
<li> Replace <tt>isAlpha</tt> in the third guard by <tt>isIdInit</tt>.

<li> In the definition of <tt>isSingle</tt>, remove the underscore '_' from the quoted list.

<li> Add the following local definition:
<pre>
  isIdInit c = isAlpha c || c == '_'
</pre>
</ul>
[These changes reflect the fact that an identifier can start with an underscore.]

<p><li> [March 2003] <strong>Page 170, Chapter 15 Indexing operations.</strong>.  
Replace the (bogus) law "<tt>map index (range (l,u)) = [0..rangeSize (l,u)]</tt>" by
<pre>
  map (index (l,u)) (range (l,u)) = [0 .. rangeSize (l,u) - 1]
</pre>

<p><li> [March 2003] <strong>Page 194, line -9, Chapter 19 Character
utilities.</strong>.  Replace "converts the to the character it
encodes" by "converts the string to the character it encodes".
