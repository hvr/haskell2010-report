<h2>Errata in the 
<a href="http://haskell.org/definition/">Revised Haskell 98 Language Report (2003)</a></h2>

The list below gives all known errors in "Haskell 98 Language and
Libraries: the Revised Report", published by Cambridge University Press
as a book, and also in the Journal of Functional Programming 13(1)
(Jan 2003).  All page references are to these texts, which may differ
slightly from the online versions.

<ul>
<li> [July 2004] <strong>Page 32, Section 3.17.2, Informal Semantics of
Pattern-Matching, case #6.</strong>
Case 6 says: "Matching against a constructor using labeled fields is
the same as matching ordinary constructor patterns except that the
fields are matched in the order they are named in the field list. All
fields listed must be declared by the constructor; fields may not
be named more than once. Fields not named by the pattern are ignored
(matched against _)."
<p>
You could interpret 'field list' to mean the order the fields appear
in the pattern, OR, the order in which the fields were declared.
The choice of interpretation affects termination behaviour.
<p>
The intention of the Report writers was to use the field order of the
pattern, not the declaration.  Thus, the Report can be clarified by
changing the end of the first sentence above to read "the order they
are named in the pattern field list".

<p><li> [July 2004] <strong>Page 32, Section 3.17.2, Informal Semantics of
Pattern-Matching, case #6.</strong>
Case 6 begins: "Matching against a constructor using labeled fields is
..."  To some readers, this could appear to invert the sense of
matching, which in all other places is used consistently to mean
matching a pattern against a value, not a value against a pattern.

<p>The proposed fix is to change the start of the sentence to read:
"Matching a constructor pattern using labeled fields is ..."

<p><li> [July 2004] <strong>Page 55, Section 4.4.2, Fixity
Declarations.</strong> The operator <tt>=&lt;&lt;</tt> defined
in the Prelude is missing from Table 4.1 - it has precedence 1,
right-associative.  Also, in the HTML version (but not the printed
versions), Table 4.1 is numbered in its caption as Table 2, although
it continues to be referred to as Table 4.1 in the text.

<p><li> [May 2003] <strong>Page 89, Section 6.3.4, The Enum Class.</strong>
Section 6.3.4 states: "For all four of these Prelude numeric types,
all of the <tt>enumFrom</tt> family of functions are strict in all
their arguments".
<p>
Alas, this contradicts the code for the Prelude in Chapter 8 for
<tt>Float</tt> and <tt>Double</tt>.  In particular, the instances for
<tt>enumFrom</tt> and <tt>enumFromThen</tt> for <tt>Float</tt> and
<tt>Double</tt> are defined in terms of <tt>numericEnumFrom</tt>,
<tt>numericEnumFromThen</tt>, which are not strict (see p113).
They both deliver an infinite list even if their argument is undefined.
<p>
The fix is presumably to add a <tt>seq</tt> to the instances for
<tt>Float</tt> and <tt>Double</tt>.

<p><li> [June 2003] <strong>Page 95, Section 6.4.6, Coercions
and Component Extraction.</strong> The specification for
<tt>properFraction</tt> does not deal properly with the case where
<em>x</em> is zero.  Here is a suggested rewording:

<p>
"The function <tt>properFraction</tt> takes a real fractional number
x and returns a pair <em>(n,f)</em> such that <em>x = n+f</em>, and:
<em>n</em> is an integral number; <em>f</em> is a fraction with the
same type as <em>x</em> and with absolute value less than 1; either
<em>n</em> is zero or <em>n</em> has the same sign as <em>x</em>;
and either <em>f</em> is zero or <em>f</em> has the same sign as
<em>x</em>."

<p><li> [Feb 2003] <strong>Page 123, Section 8.2, PreludeText.</strong>
In the definition of <tt>lex</tt> make the following changes:
<ul>
<li> Replace <tt>isAlpha</tt> in the third guard by <tt>isIdInit</tt>.
<li> In the definition of <tt>isSingle</tt>, remove the underscore
     '_' from the quoted list.
<li> Add the following local definition:
<pre>
  isIdInit c = isAlpha c || c == '_'
</pre>
</ul>
[These changes reflect the fact that an identifier can start with
an underscore.]

<p><li> [Sept 2004] <strong>Page 136, Chapter 9.5 Context-Free
Syntax.</strong>  The third production for <em>export</em> does
not match the production and explanation given earlier in Section 5.2.
Replace the <em>qvar</em> in parentheses after <em>qtycls</em> with
<em>var</em>.


<p><li> [March 2003] <strong>Page 170, Chapter 15 Indexing
operations.</strong>  Replace the (bogus) law
<pre>
  map index (range (l,u)) = [0..rangeSize (l,u)]
</pre>
by
<pre>
  map (index (l,u)) (range (l,u)) = [0 .. rangeSize (l,u) - 1]
</pre>

<p><li> [March 2003] <strong>Page 194, line -9, Chapter 19 Character
utilities.</strong>  Replace "converts the to the character it
encodes" by "converts the string to the character it encodes".


<p><li> [July 2003] <strong>Index to the online version (only).</strong>
<ul>
<li>The type for <tt>either</tt> is missing.
<li>
The type for <tt>print</tt> should be
<pre>
   print :: Show a =&gt; a -&gt; IO ()
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>
