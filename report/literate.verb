\index{literate comments}

The ``literate comment''
convention, first developed by Richard Bird and Philip Wadler for
Orwell, and inspired in turn by Donald Knuth's ``literate
programming'', is an alternative style for encoding \Haskell{} source
code. 
The literate style encourages comments by making them the default.  A
line in which ``@>@'' is the first character is treated as part of the
program; all other lines are comment.

The program text is recovered
by taking only those lines beginning with ``@>@'', 
and replacing the leading ``@>@'' with a space.
Layout and comments apply
exactly as described in Appendix~\ref{syntax} in the resulting text.

To capture some cases where one omits an ``@>@'' by mistake, it is an
error for a program line to appear adjacent to a non-blank comment line,
where a line is taken as blank if it consists only of whitespace.

By convention, the style of comment is indicated by the file
extension, with ``@.hs@'' indicating a usual Haskell file and
``@.lhs@'' indicating a literate Haskell file.  Using this style, a
simple factorial program would be:
\bprog
@
   This literate program prompts the user for a number
   and prints the factorial of that number:

> main :: IO ()

> main = do putStr "Enter a number: "
>           l <- readLine
>           putStr "n!= "
>           print (fact (read l))
          
  This is the factorial function.

> fact :: Integer -> Integer
> fact 0 = 1
> fact n = n * fact (n-1)
@
\eprog


An alternative style of literate programming is particularly
suitable for use with the LaTeX text processing system.
In this convention, only those parts of the literate program that are
entirely enclosed between @\begin{code}@$\ldots$@\end{code}@ delimiters are
treated as program text; all other lines are comment.  It is not necessary
to insert additional blank lines before or after these delimiters, though
it may be stylistically desirable.  For example,
\bprog
@
\documentstyle{article}

\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}

This is a trivial program that prints the first 20 factorials.

\begin{code}
main :: IO ()
main =  print [ (n, product [1..n]) | n <- [1..20]]
\end{code}

\end{document}
@
\eprog
This style uses the same file extension.  It is not advisable to mix
these two styles in the same file.
