Notes on building the report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly:

        $ cd tools
        $ make

should build a few tools required for building the report itself.
Then you should be able to say

        $ cd report
        $ make

to build the PS (haskell.ps) and HTML (in haskell-report-html)
versions.  To get PDF, use ps2pdf on the PS version.

When you check in a patch to the darcs repo, darcs will automatically
try to re-build the tools and report.  If it fails for any reason, then
your patch will be rejected.  (This is controlled by the top-level
Makefile target 'default', and the darcs preferences.)  If you think
your patch is fine, but the build system is broken, then you might need
to login to darcs.haskell.org and do some fixing by hand.

[
  There are various other Makefile rules; for example 'make release' at
  the top level was supposed to build a complete release of the "Revised
  Haskell 98 Report", although it doesn't work out of the box.  For
  Haskell', we'll want to modify these Makefiles to do what we want in
  due course.
